# django-profiles
Django code dealing with templates, user profiles, image files, user login, admin customizations and other fun stuffs experimented via developing a simple social media site.
We will be using the following:
* Python 3.x
* Django 2.x
* Boostrap 4.x
* Crispy forms (Django module)
* jquery(cdn mode)
* sqlite3

## How to install:
* Create virtualenv with Python 3.x
* Activate the virtualenv
* Install the required modules using pip install -r requirements.txt
* runserver

## How to use:
* migrate (creates admin related data)
* create super user .. ex: admin
* through admin, create multiple users (or directly create userprofiles)
* feel free to add images in the admin->userprofile forms ..
* The package has 2 apps, Viz., ui (for user interactive forms .. like login/profile/password etc ... ) and core (that contains the friend logic and connections)
* with few userprofiles created, login to home page ...
* click on UI button to see some static information
* click on home and you should be able to add posts ...
* the user initially will have no friends but all the userprofiles under 'Other folks' with 'Friend' buttons
* Any Friend on the friend list can be unfriended.
